# Global_Problem
## New project from Kodland.Made to reduce global warming.


### My idea about how to create my project:



1.Test the user's knowledge about the GP in a question-answer format (quiz/test)

2.Tell the user about the GP and what the temperature will be and how the world will change in n years

### From where could I take information?
